Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to enable artificial systems to act autonomously and rationally. This includes equipping them with basic capabilities from human intelligence, such as planning future actions, reasoning about known information, or learning from experience.
2 Areas of AI

Planning: The task of finding sequence of actions to accomplish a goal in discrete, deterministic, static, fully observable environment (AMAAI, p. 362). Project Tic-Tac-Toe - Implementation of minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms to solve "adversarial search and games" problem

Knowledge & Reasoning: Knowledge is a field of AI which uses reasoning for an internal representation of knowledge extracted by the logical techniques "induction" and "Deduction" to decide what actions to take (AMAAI, p. 226). Project Knights and Knaves - Implementation of "Propositinal Logic" (knowledge base) to decide (reason) if a statement is True or False
